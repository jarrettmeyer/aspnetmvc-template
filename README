This is freely available as a sample application for the following technologies.

   + ASP.NET MVC

        - Specifically showing how to build an application with all content in one
          project and all code in another. NO CODE (other than global.asax.cs)
          goes in the web project.

        - Demonstrates RESTful Rails-like routes. Makes use of all HTTP methods,
          GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. If you have reason to not support older
          browser models, then you will need to change the routing.

   + NHibernate (and Fluent NHibernate)
