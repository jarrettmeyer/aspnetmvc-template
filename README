This is freely available as a sample application for the following
technologies.

   + ASP.NET MVC

        - Specifically showing how to build an application with all content in
          one project and all code in another. NO CODE (other than 
          global.asax.cs) goes in the web project.

        - Demonstrates RESTful, Rails-like routes. Makes use of all HTTP
          methods, GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. If you have reason to not 
          support older browser models, then you will need to change the 
          routing.
          
        - Demonstrates RESTful, Rails-like nested routes. This can be a little
          bit tricky to do with ASP.NET MVC, since you have to write all of the
          routing yourself. 
          
        - Demonstrates use of Anti-Forgery Tokens, including their use in 
          javascript-enable delete links.
          
   + jQuery
    
       - Updated to jQuery 1.4.

   + NHibernate (incl. Fluent NHibernate and Linq-to-NHibernate)
   
       - Uses simple, method-level generics for IRepository instance. This does
         not include a per-model repository.
   
   + Ninject
   
        - Uses the InRequestScope option of Ninject to manage the NHibernate
          ISession.
